Vibe Coder Stack Planner MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol server that helps non-technical builders ("vibe coders") 
plan the right tech stack for their ideas through progressive questioning.

This server follows Vibe Coder Best Practices (2025):
- Web-first approach: 90% of projects work great as web apps (mobile browsers work excellently)
- Modern serverless architecture: Next.js + Neon/Supabase + Vercel
- Start small, scale up: Always assume starting with small user base initially
- Platform-as-a-Service focus: Avoid complex infrastructure setup
- AI-friendly tooling: Technologies with excellent AI assistant support

Key Principles:
- Simple, jargon-free questions
- Interactive process (user must provide answers, agent presents questions)
- Practical deployment guidance
- Cost-effective recommendations with generous free tiers
- Modern 2025 tech stack (includes newer features like Neon Auth beta)
