Vibe Coder Stack Planner MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol server that helps non-technical builders ("vibe coders") 
plan the right tech stack for their ideas through progressive questioning using 
the MCP elicitation spec.

This server focuses on:
- Simple, jargon-free questions
- Platform-as-a-Service recommendations
- Practical deployment guidance

2. **Backend Strategy:** Platform-as-a-Service approach because:

   - Built-in scaling and security features
   - Pay-as-you-grow pricing model
   
3. **Database Selection:** Based on your data needs:
   - Managed databases reduce maintenance burden
   - Built-in backup and security features
   - Automatic scaling capabilities
   
4. **Hosting Platform:** Cloud-native deployment because:
