# Usage Examples for Vibe Coder Stack Planner

## Key Principle: Interactive Process

**IMPORTANT**: This MCP server requires user interaction. The agent should present questions from the server to the user and wait for the user's responses. The agent should NOT answer the questions itself.

## Example Conversation Flow

Here's how a typical interaction with the MCP server would look:

### User starts planning
```
User: I have an idea for a project but don't know what tech stack to use. Can you help me figure it out?

AI: I'll help you plan the perfect tech stack! Let me use the vibe coder stack planner to ask you some simple questions about your idea.

[AI calls start_project_planning tool]
```

### Step 1: Project Vision
```
Server: Let's start planning your project! First, tell me about your vision.

What problem are you trying to solve, or what idea do you want to build? 
Think about it like you're explaining to a friend - what would this thing do and why would people want to use it?

User: I want to build a simple task management app for my small team. We're always forgetting who's supposed to do what and when things are due. It would help us stay organized and track our progress.
```

### Step 2: Users & Interaction
```
Server: Great! Now let's talk about who will use this.

Who do you imagine using your project? How do you picture them using it?

User: 
- Target users: My team of about 8 people, mostly designers and developers
- Usage: We'd check it daily to see our tasks, update progress, and assign new work to each other
```

### Step 3: Features & Data
```
Server: Perfect! Now let's think about what your project actually needs to do.

What are the main things people will do with your project?
What kind of information will your project work with?

User:
- Core features: Create tasks, assign them to team members, set due dates, mark as complete, see everyone's workload
- Data needs: Task details, user profiles, assignment info, due dates, completion status
```

### Step 4: Scale & Timeline
```
Server: Great! Let's talk about your expectations for growth and timing.

How many people do you think might use this?
When do you want to have something working?

User: 
- Scale: Small community (dozens of people) - maybe other small teams like ours
- Timeline: Within a few weeks for a basic version
```

### Step 5: Budget & Technical Comfort
```
Server: Almost done! Last questions about resources and comfort level.

What's your budget situation for this project?
How comfortable are you with technical stuff?

User:
- Budget: Can spend a little bit (~$10-50/month)
- Technical comfort: I can handle basic setup with good instructions
```

### Final Recommendation
```
Server: ðŸŽ‰ Perfect! Based on what you've told me, here's my recommendation:

**Recommended Tech Stack:**
â€¢ Frontend: Next.js 15 with App Router
â€¢ Backend: Next.js API routes with Neon (serverless Postgres) + Clerk auth
â€¢ Styling: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
â€¢ Hosting: Vercel
â€¢ Domain: Namecheap (~$12/year)

**Estimated monthly cost:** $20-50/month
**Setup complexity:** Low - guided setup with excellent AI coding assistant support

Use the `get_deployment_guide` tool to get step-by-step instructions for setting this up!
```

## Alternative Usage Patterns

### Quick Recommendation (Skip Interactive Flow)
```
User: Can you recommend a tech stack for a blog with user comments?

AI: I'll get you a quick recommendation based on typical blog requirements.

[AI calls recommend_stack with basic blog requirements]

Server: **Tech Stack Recommendation:**
â€¢ Frontend: Next.js with Tailwind CSS
â€¢ Backend: Vercel Functions for serverless API
â€¢ Database: Supabase for user management and comments
â€¢ Hosting: Vercel (free tier)

Perfect for a blog with user interaction, easy to set up, and cost-effective.
```

### Get Deployment Instructions
```
User: How do I actually deploy this recommended stack?

AI: Let me get you step-by-step deployment instructions.

[AI calls get_deployment_guide]

Server: **Deployment Guide for Your Project**

**Phase 1: Setup (Day 1)**
1. Install development tools:
   - Download VS Code: code.visualstudio.com
   - Install Node.js: nodejs.org
   - Create GitHub account

2. Create your project:
   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@latest task-manager
   cd task-manager
   ```

[...detailed steps continue...]
```

### Explanation of Recommendations
```
User: Why did you suggest Supabase instead of building my own backend?

AI: Let me explain the reasoning behind the recommendations.

[AI calls explain_recommendation with detail_level="detailed"]

Server: **Detailed Technical Reasoning:**

**Architecture Decisions:**
1. **Supabase Choice:** Based on your technical comfort level and timeline:
   - Reduces operational overhead (no server management)
   - Built-in authentication and database
   - PostgreSQL database with real-time features
   - Automatic API generation from your schema

2. **Why not custom backend:**
   - Would require server setup, security configuration
   - Database management and backups
   - Authentication system implementation
   - API development and maintenance

This saves you weeks of development time and lets you focus on your team's task management features.

## Integration with Claude Desktop

To use this with Claude Desktop, add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vibe-stack-planner": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/vibe_coder_stack_planner",
        "python",
        "run_server.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Then restart Claude Desktop and you can ask:
- "Help me plan a tech stack for my project idea"
- "I want to build [description] - what should I use?"
- "Can you walk me through choosing the right tools for my app?"

The server will guide you through the interactive planning process using elicitation!
